# Transformer Attention Visualizer  

📌 **Summary**  
A tool to extract, analyze, and visualize attention patterns in Transformer models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.). It provides interactive heatmaps, flow diagrams, and comparative dashboards to explore how models attend to tokens across layers and heads.  

🎯 **Objective**  
To help researchers, developers, and students understand Transformer attention mechanisms through real-time, multi-scale, and interactive visualizations.  

🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- Python, PyTorch  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Streamlit (frontend)  
- Plotly & Matplotlib (visualizations)  
- HDF5 (data storage)  

🚀 **Applications**  
- Model debugging & bias detection  
- Linguistic research on syntax/semantics  
- Educational tool for teaching Transformers  
- AI safety & alignment analysis  
- Industrial model optimization  

🔮 **Future Use**  
- Cross-model comparison dashboards  
- Attention-guided model compression  
- Collaborative, real-time visualization platform
